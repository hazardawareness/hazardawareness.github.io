           <h2>Services</h2>
               <div class="service">
               <h3>Completely bespoke website design </h3>
            <p>While working with existing frameworks and modifying themes is a great cost effective solution that is best for 90% of young start-ups needing to get online, some larger and more established companies need that little more. If you’ve got an existing established brand that you want replicated identically online, I can work design and build your completely custom website.</p>
               </div>
             <div class="service">
            <h3>Wordpress CMS Backend</h3>

            <h3>Branding</h3>
            <p>Every start up needs more than just a logo, they need a brand that defines them and helps them stand out in any field. I can either work with an existing logo to create a full brand style around that or start from scratch to design &amp; develop a unique identity for your business. A great logo needs to work in multiple sizes, colours, mediums and specifications. It also needs to appeal to your target market but also yourself so you can confident in how your business looks.</p>

            <p>To get your name out there it’s not enough to rely on word of mouth and organic search results - you need an advertising campaign that puts your name and brand directly on your potential customer’s screens. With flash advertising dying and more browsers HTML5 capable than supporting flash – an animated online campaign can get your message across more easily. </p>
