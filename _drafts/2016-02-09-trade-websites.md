# Marketing for Tradespeople

Traditionally most trade work comes from word of mouth, prices are roughly equivalent and you've got enough work in your local area. You know your competition and they're much the same.

### The start from scratch

As Perth grows, people's networks diversify. Multiplied by the number of expats and immigrants and now not everyone knows a plumber or has a friend who knows a carpenter. Without this trusted reference you need them to find you and to build trust instantly. 

There are multiple sources these customers use to search including Google, *insert other trade listings here* and if you're not there, you're not seen.

### The researcher

Some have no references, others have multiple. Others still, compare their references with those they search for. Especially in residential trade and customers who want the ultimate outcome (who should be willing to pay) will compare you to your competition. 

## How to secure these customers

First and foremost you need an online presence - one that portrays you in the best light, features your best work, your happiest customers and your details to get hold of you. 

Historically a lot of sole traders and small trade business have coped and thrived without a brand or web presence but with the market slow down and saturation, that's getting harder and harder to do.
