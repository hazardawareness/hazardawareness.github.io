                     <p><a href="http://myhealthaddiction.com.au/" target="_blank">My Health Addiction</a> is an ecommerce site in the health and wellness industry selling "what's truly good for you". This ongoing work includes everything from branding and logo design to website building and marketing.</p>

                     <p>The website was created using a customised child theme as a completely custom ecommerce design would run into the 10â€™s of thousands and while Ryan was still working out exactly what he wanted, it could have been a lot of money wasted. As MHA grows and diversifies, I'm able to use my knowledge and skills to move with the business and quickly.</p>

                    <h3>Sew &amp; Co</h3>
                    <p>Sew &amp; Co is another local business that already had a brand but needed help with a web presense. I was happy to help out. The bold colours and strong brand really lent itself to using a pre-designed theme that I could modify. With my set up and the clients strong wordpress skills this was the best option. The other advantage is that with the multitude of wordpress plugins, there's great potential for adding more functionality with bookings, downloads and more.</p>
                     <p>I also set them up with an email marketing program so they can contact and send information to their current and potential clients.</p>

                    <h3>Crush Website</h3>
                    <p>When I started working at Crush, one of my first projects was a complete overhall of the company website. As is often the case with many design firms and freelancers (guilty as charged!) we spend so much time and effort creating the best, most up to date websites for our clients, that we often neglect our personal websites for too long and their age creeps up. </p>
                     <p>We wanted to keep the strong brand and produce a clean and completely reponsive website that gave our potential and current customers everything they needed without the hassel.</p>
                     <p>This was my first responsive project that I took from design through development and it was a great introduction into the complexities and best practive of responsive web design and building. I used a grid framework for this project but the more reponsive sites I built and the more I learnt, the less I wanted what frameworks had to offer and instead relied on a few base snippets implementing the preferred techniques that I could built upon for each new site.</p>

                    <h3>The Windsor</h3>
                    <p>Restaurant websites offer their own set of very unique challenges. They're usually evenly split between desktop users researching where to go and what a place is like,  and mobile users needing fast loading sites and information on the go. Navigation needs to be clear, menus and contact details need to be quickly accessible but the site also has to stand out and portray the brand, venue atmosphere and clientele.  </p>

            <p>I don't have a lot to say, yet.
