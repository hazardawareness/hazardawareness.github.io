Developing a brand for a local business…

### Website Design &amp; Build

I had already had a pair of wheels build by Adrian at Melody Wheels and wanted to spread his trade so more cyclists could ride incredible custom built wheels. Adrian was using a stock theme at wordpress.com but to built his brand and business he needed something custom built for him. Adrian already had heaps of content included built wheels and tech articles. I worked with him to bring these into a site that was easy to separate what he does, wheels he's built and interesting articles with potential to expand as his business grows.

Adrian wanted a simple and clean design which was perfect for letting the skill of his trade shine through. We built a custom page to easily display all wheels built as well as filter by cycling discipline. The site also had to be easy to use on a mobile and quick.
