<p>A successful online store in a crowded market at a budget?</p>

<h3 id="fullbranddesignwebsitemarketing">Full brand design, website &amp; marketing</h3>

<p>When Ryan came to me he had a business model that mostly involved selling his high quality protein and other health food goods through word of mouth. To expand and increase automation he needed to create an online store and develop a new brand to drive that store. My Health Addiction was built from selling &#8216;What&#8217;s truly good for you&#8217; and the iconographic logo and colour scheme complements this</p>

The website was created using a customised child theme as a completely custom ecommerce design would run into the 10’s of thousands and while Ryan was still working out exactly what he wanted, it could have been a lot of money wasted. As MHA grows and diversifies, I'm able to use my knowledge and skills to move with the business and quickly.

>Patrick was great to work with and created a brand that was a massive hit with my customers. He was really helpful and always explained what he was doing every step of the way. I would definitely recommend him to anyone starting a small business in Perth.
