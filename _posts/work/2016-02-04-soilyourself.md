Custom WordPress theme design and development for an online store.

### Website Design

Traditionally the trade supplies industry have been afraid of displaying prices online and never considered creating an online store to make it easy for their customers to order. Simon at Soil Yourself thought differently and wanted an online store where both trade and retail customers could order what they need and simplify the process for Simon.

One of the challenges in this re-design was that a store to order products like soil requires specific functionality and design changes that aren't included with woocommerce out of the box. We used customer shipping tables, completely changed the store layout and included a system where Simon could easily take orders for trade customers on the go and add it to their accounts. We also completely revamped the images and let them stand out with bright orange borders on the slate background. This site also included custom calculators and postcode checkers to completely automate the order process and inform the user

> After 18 months of trying to find a decent website designer, I was ready to give up! Then I was recommended to Paddy.. The website he built for me exceeded all expectations of design, functionality and value for money, and the ongoing support is second to none. I would highly recommend his services to anyone in search of a quality website.
