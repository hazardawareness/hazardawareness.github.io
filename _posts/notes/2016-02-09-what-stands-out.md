# Standing out

> If everything stands out, nothing stands out

The number one rule of design. If everything stands out, nothing stands out. 

It applies to all design, from web design, poster design, app design and more. 

If you change the colour, size or shape of one call to action it will stand out. If you change it on all of them, none of them will stand out.

If you make a your main header large it will stand out. If you make all your headers large, none of them will stand out.

Design is about deciding the main point or call to action you want the viewer to take and making **that** stand out to them.
