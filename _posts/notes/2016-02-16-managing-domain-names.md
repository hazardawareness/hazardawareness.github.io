# Your company's most important digital asset

As a web builder, I'm more than happy to manage your hosting, domain name setting (DNS), website and other *tech problems*. It makes it easier, when I control it I know how it's all set up and it's one less thing you need to worry about. 

I do, however, **strongly recommend** that even if you want me to set everything up, that you are the owners of your domain name.

Purchasing a domain name is incredibly simple in this day and age. There are some great value and incredible Australian registrars – [NetRegistry](http://netregistry.com.au), [VentraIP](http://ventraip.com.au) – that quickly guide you through the process and don't add too many unnecessary extras into your cart. 

### The Benefits

I've worked with too many clients who have had to change their company domain name or go through lengthy and draining conflicts with a previous *web agency* who don't want to give up a client. 

Sometimes the company might have gone under and no-one knows who might still have the logins. In this case, the domain renewal emails forward to the great email graveyard and yourcompany.com might end up in the hands of the competition who have *reserved* your name.

Once you've lost a domain name there is little the courts can do to help you. If you are struggling to get back a .com address from a non-american entity you're even more out of luck. There is no set legal process to regain access to a lost or stolen domain and any attempts will run into very large legal bills very quickly.

By being the registrant behind your domain name you can always get it pointed to a new website if things go sour, control who can access the details and stay on top of domain renewal emails.

### The Technicalities

Domain name settings (DNS) can get very, very complicated. Luckily, once set up they're not often changed. Once they work, they generally just work. If you're just purchased a domain name, your web team will change the DNS so your emails and website work. If you're taking over control of an existing domain, these DNS settings will need to be transferred. When transferred correctly, there should be no down-time with your website, emails or other online services.
