<p>If you are still in the planning stages of starting your own business then you know you&#8217;ll need a website, emails another standard tech services. This three-part eSeries breaks down exactly <strong>what</strong> you need, <strong>why</strong> you need it, <strong>where</strong> to get it and <strong>how</strong> much it should cost. </p>

<p><strong>Part 1 – About domain names</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="domainnamesexplained">Domain names explained</h3>

<p>A domain name is a unique series of letters followed by a TLD (Top Level Domain, e.g. .com.au or .com) that you own. If you&#8217;re still deciding on your company name then it&#8217;s worth considering available domain names during the process. If you have already decided on your own or have an established company that needs a web presence then you&#8217;ll need to find the best available name to represent your business online. There are fewer and fewer available domains from common words and phases but as most people will search a companies name before typing a URL in directly, length of domain name is less of an issue.</p>

<p>A good place to search for available domain names is either <a href="http://www.netregistry.com.au">Net Registry</a> or <a href="http://ventraip.com.au">VentraIP</a>. To purchase domain names I&#8217;d recommend VentraIP as their customer support is top notch, their prices are great and they include unlimited DNS hosting - more on that below. </p>

<p>You can expect to pay around $15-$30 per year for most domains including .com.au and .com. If your business is primarily located in Australia then go with the .com.au. Google prioritise local domains for local searches and you&#8217;re more likely to get a good .com.au over .com name. Whoever registers the domain owns and controls it, so when working with a web design company it&#8217;s recommended that you purchase the domain and allow them access instead of letting them manage it for you.</p>

<h3 id="thednstrilogy">The DNS trilogy</h3>

<p>Your domain just proves ownership over that URL - you still need to tell the world where to find your website and email servers. That’s the job of DNS (Domain Name Settings). These transfer your human readable url or email address into computer readable series of numbers (IP address, e.g. 192.168.0.1) to find the corresponding server. Most domain name registrars include DNS but some of the budget ones (e.g. CrazyDomains) charge you more for all these <em>essential</em> extras.</p>

<p>Without DNS settings any emails sent to your domain will go nowhere and no one will ever be able to find your website. These can be very complicated and will appear as complete gibberish to anyone not trained but your web developer will know exactly what settings you&#8217;ll need. Once changed, DNS settings can take up to 24 hours to fully change worldwide although this is more usually 4&#8211;8 hours especially if your potential customers are all in the same country. It means that once a domain name has been purchased, it will usually be the next day before your emails and website are good to go.</p>

<h3 id="multipledomainnames">Multiple domain names</h3>

<p>As domain names are relatively cheap and disappear quickly it&#8217;s usually a good idea to purchase multiple TLDs if available. You might want to run your business from businessname.com.au but you never know when you&#8217;ll expand internationally or sell to an investor and owning the .com, .co or other relevant domains from the start allows you to mix and match or combine them. They can also be useful if your business is comprised of multiple parts or you have some very distinct products that warrant their own website. e.g. product1.com and product2.com can <em>point</em> to companyname.com/product1 and companyname.com.au/product2. These techniques are useful not only for future business expansion but also for search engine optimisation (SEO).</p>
