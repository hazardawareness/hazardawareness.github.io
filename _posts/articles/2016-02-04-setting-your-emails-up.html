<h2 id="startuppart2–gettingyouremailssetup">Start Up Part 2 – Getting your emails set up</h2>

<p>Once you have your domain name purchased you can now use a customised email - yourname@yourcompany.com - and for that you need an email provider. Most budget hosting appears to also give you unlimited free email accounts. Using these is a terrible idea and should never be done by anyone. That 5/month website hosting with unlimited email accounts might seem like a good deal but it will come round and cost you more in the long run. If you still need more convincing read below.</p>

<h4 id="whyyouneverusewebsitehostingemails.">Why you never use website hosting emails.</h4>

<ol>
<li>Most hosting is shared hosting with multiple websites on the one server. If one of these gets hacked and starts sending out spam email, that server will be blacklisted and your emails will get sent through to spam. Website server emails are very often sent to spam.</li>
<li>To counteract this, hosts will make you use your internet service provider to send emails through. This is all fine when set up with your iinet/telstra/ISP at home but take your laptop somewhere else or try to send emails from your phone and there will be errors.</li>
<li>All servers go down. Website servers are much more unreliable than email service providers and while you won&#8217;t notice the odd downtime here or there on your website - with emails it means bounced back messages and emails not received.</li>
<li>Dedicated email service providers sync your emails so open one on outlook and it will show as read on your phone. This is a lifesaver for managing your emails.</li>
<li>When reading or composing emails through your web browser hosting webmail is always very clunky, hard to use and slow compared to dedicated webmail services.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Always use a separate email service and hosting service. Every time. Always.</strong></p>

<h3 id="googleappsemailprovider">Google Apps email provider</h3>

<p>For most people Google apps is hands down the best email service provider and includes Google drive cloud storage, team calendars and all of Google&#8217;s other cloud services too. This service costs $55 per user, per year. This cost is per individual inbox so if there&#8217;s only you in your company for now, it will only cost $55 per year even if you wanted separate sales@, info@ and as many other aliases as you want. Managing these accounts is easy and you can add more users as your team grows.</p>

<p>Google apps also includes Google Docs for you to create and store all of your company documents, spreadsheets and powerpoints, edit these on any computer in the world and collaborate with other users. Whilst google apps is completely compatible with email programs like Outlook and Mail on a mac, it sometimes has some funny behaviours due to gmail using labels instead of folders. For ultimate compatibility with outlook the recommended email provider is Office 365.</p>

<h3 id="microsoftoffice365">Microsoft Office 365</h3>

<p>The other main player in cloud email services is Microsoft. Their offering is more expensive at around $210 per user per year but does include a license for Office 365 for each user - this can save you money if you plan to use word, excel and powerpoint frequently. They also have a plan for just business email at $7 per user per month if you already have or don&#8217;t plan to use the Microsoft Office suite.</p>

<p>Whichever you choose to go with, setting them up involves registering for a free trial account with your domain name, updating the DNS, creating your users and setting up the accounts on whatever devices you want to access your emails from. If during the free trial you decide that the email service isn&#8217;t working for you it&#8217;s usually fairly easy to switch and migrate your emails from one service to another.</p>
