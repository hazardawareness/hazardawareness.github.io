<h2 id="websitehosting">Website Hosting</h2>

<p>As well as your email service provider, your DNS also points your domain to your hosting service provider. With such a wide range of products filled with technical jargon it can be very hard to know what hosting solution is best for you. The needs of local cafe will be very different to someone setting up an online store who will also be different to the likes of a giant ecommerce superstore. Your web developer will be able to advise based on expected visitors, functionality needed, size of the site and other factors. For 90% of small businesses and start-ups who don&#8217;t have any extended functionality, a good quality shared hosting account is adequate to start out with. Again the recommended hosts are companies like SiteGround, VentraIP and Crucial. There are lots of very low cost hosts out there that lack speed, reliability, customer support and up-time. </p>

<h2 id="comingsoonpage">Coming soon page!</h2>

<p>So you&#8217;ve decided to start up your own business, have spoken to people to get the word out and suddenly it all kicks off and people want to know more. You might not even have the brand designed yet, let alone a website with all of your information on. You&#8217;ll need some sort of coming soon splash page to verify your presence online and provide quick contact details. A mailing list sign-up form will capture potential customer&#8217;s details instantly and can be set up quickly. You would begin your email marketing campaign once you have more information and are closer to a finished product so when you officially open your doors - the customers are already waiting outside!</p>

<p>The best email marketing provider in most cases is <a href="http://mailchimp.com">Mailchimp</a>. Their tools and service are second to none and they offer a free tier for under 2000 subscribers which lets you build your email database at no extra cost. Don&#8217;t worry about your emails just yet, all you need now is an account so a form can be placed on your coming soon page. More information about setting up your email marketing is in a later eSeries.</p>

<p>Aside from prospective customer collection, on your coming soon page you usually only need your contact details and logo. Trying to add too much here takes time and focus away from creating your main online presence.</p>

<p>Hopefully by now you have partnered with a great web designer and developer as this stage you&#8217;ll need their skills, knowledge and ability to create the best online presence for you. Whilst it is possible to create a website using online knowledge and tools, a good web designer will paint your business in a much better light by creating a more professional site that is optimised for your brand and customers.</p>

<h2 id="content">Content</h2>

<p>You should already have an idea of what you want to say to your customers by now and it&#8217;s imperative that you have a rough draft of this written down before the website is designed. Much of a site structure depends on what you want to say and how much writing it takes to say it – the rest is just making that look perfect on a screen.</p>

<p>A good place to start is list out all the pages you might think you&#8217;d want. Even if they don&#8217;t all become pages or you add more later, this first stage gives you an idea of how much you&#8217;ll need to write. From there just keep adding and refining the words. It&#8217;s easier to design with more copy than less as extra copy can be split into sections and moved to other pages or sections. As much as your web designer can know about your business and the industry - you will know more so it&#8217;s better to not let them guess. </p>

<p>Content also includes any images, videos and other media you might want to showcase. Whilst most start-ups don&#8217;t have the budget for professional photography and video editing it&#8217;s very important these are of high quality. If your service or product is still being developed you can use related stock and general photography. Having an idea of what look you&#8217;re going for will give your designer something to aim for and find visual representations of your business. A good designer knows techniques to make the most of phone and stock photography that include page layout, colour correction, cropping and more.</p>

<h2 id="budget-howlongisapieceofstring">Budget - How long is a piece of string?</h2>

<p>Your website and online presence is an investment in yourself and your business. As with most things in life, you generally get what you pay for but a good web developer will be able to work with your budget and spend it most effectively if your initial set up funds are constrained. Cutting costs here can effect the perceived view of your brand, reduce web sales, turn users away and have other negative effects. </p>

<p>By using open source CMSs and frameworks (e.g. WordPress, WooCommerce) it is possible to add functionality quickly and effectively without extended set up costs and time. By using a framework or CMS with a lot of potential it&#8217;s possible to set up a basic website initially and add functionality later once you&#8217;ve refined your business plan and are ready to invest more.</p>

<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>

<p>As most websites now are built on a Content Management System (CMS) you also need to factor in keeping it backed up and updated. As the most popular website CMS - (running 1/4 of all websites) - WordPress is often targeted by hackers. You can fend off 99.99% of attacks if you keep you website updated and your web developer follows standard procedures to secure the site. For the rare 0.01% of the times (or for other unforeseen circumstances) you&#8217;ll need a regular backup to ensure your website is up and running straight away. </p>
