            <h2>Why I built this blog on a banana pi </h2>
            <time>22nd March 2015</time>
            <p>I needed to learn more about servers and the banana pi seemed like a relatively inexpensive way to learn that I knew I’d find interesting. I feel the more I know about the technologies and broader subject of my field, the better I understand my field.</p>
            <p>I also wanted to host my main portfolio site on a fast yet cost effective platform and GitHub pages stood out as the best option for me. This blog is just a side-experiment for me so hosting it on my own little server, running off my own internet connection is fine for me. My portfolio is reliable, if this blog goes down or I break it, no big deal if it’s offline for a bit. The more that goes wrong, the more I learn! </p>
            <p>Eventually as this grows, my server admin skills combined with running a raspberry Pi off a 4g home internet connection will show its limitations but that will give me more of an incentive to either migrate to a cloud service like AWS (where my server admin experiment here will be the stepping stone) or to run my blog completely off GitHub pages and learn Jekyll.</p>
            <p>I chose to build this site only supporting the latest browsers and technology as that is what truly excites me and let's me try out new things. To learn. By only supporting and testing on up to date browsers (no IE9 and below) I can change my site quicker, with less headaches and provide a better experience to my visitors who also care about the web.  </p>
